# GIFtastic-app
An app to display trending GIFs on a topic of your choice using the GIPHY API

###What:
This is a web app created using JS/JQuery, Bootstrap framework, and CSS to display trending GIFs on a topic of the user's choice. Some pre-defined buttons exist to get the user started, but they have the option to add their own buttons to the page in order to call on the GIPHY API.

###Why:
It's fun! This was a project for me to learn how to make AJAX calls and use external APIs to interface a web app with actual content that may be useful to a user.

###How to get started:
Feel free to clone the repo to access the code and get started. You will, however, have to get your own API key from [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/), which is available for free.

###How to look for help:
Reach out to me if you need help understanding any of the code for this app. I'd be happy to explain it to you!
